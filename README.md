# PICKLIST
Digital pick list, complementing a commercial warehouse management system (WMS). 
In daily use for 10 years, now!


Vegetable delivery service takes over organic food store to expand its assortment. Products have to be picked from shop shelves.
WMS provided paper picklists, only. Those did not fullfill basic requirements. Neither did the commercial digital solution which even had disadvantages over the paper picklist. *Analog* picking from a shop rather a warehouse was time-consuming and error-prone. Picking staff not used to computers.



Solution 

1. Tapping the WMS for the **Data** and preparation of the picklist on PC
2. **Picking** process on mobile notebooks with barcode scanners initially attached to picking trolleys
3. **Post-processing** of the data on PC for updating the WMS

-Packing sequence according to storage location and divided into delivery tours. (2 tours at a time)

-Barcode scan prevents mispicks.

-Information to find the product clearly displayed (storage location, manufacturer, name, weightâ€¦).

***Issues:***
-Rare barcodes other than EAN not processed reliably

***'to add one day':***
-picture of the product to pick (from WMS, ecoinform or DataNatuRE).
-standalone solution, not VBA.
-augmented reality (Google glasses like) to mark product in view.

WMS: BioOffice
