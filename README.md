# PICKLIST
Digital pick list, complementing a commercial warehouse management system (WMS). 
In daily use for over 10 years, now!


Vegetable delivery service takes over organic food store to expand its assortment. 
We got only basic paper picklists from the WMS that did not meet our requirements. Neither did the commercial digital solution which even had disadvantages over the paper picklist.
*Analog* picking from a store rather a warehouse was time-consuming and error-prone. 



Solution 

My solution in three parts:
1. Tapping the WMS for the **Data** and preparation of the picklist on PC
2. **Picking** process on a mobile notebook with barcode scanner attached to a picking trolley
2b. UserForm
3. **Post-processing** of the data for remigrating into the WMS on PC

-Packing sequence according to storage location and divided into delivery tours. (2 tours at a time)

-Barcode scan prevents mispicks.

-Information to find the product clearly displayed (storage location, manufacturer, name, weightâ€¦).

***Issues:***
-Rare barcodes other than EAN not processed reliably

***to add one day:***
-picture of the product to pick (from WMS, ecoinform or DataNatuRE).
-standalone solution, not VBA.
-augmented reality (Google glasses like) to mark product in view.

WMS: BioOffice
